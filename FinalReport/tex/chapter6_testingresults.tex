\chapter{Testing}
This chapter details the testing that was carried out to assess the different aspects of the system, such as the human detection and direction, as well as the powered wheelchair and Hololens system as a whole. We begin this section with our testing of the detection system. We provide a discussion of the results in the following chapter.

\section{Human Detection Testing}
This section is concerned with testing the Human Detection \& Direction system. To ensure the system will be able to detect real people moving around in the surroundings, it is necessary to test the system detecting people at different distances and the directions they are facing. We utilize the Microsoft Hololens and the HDD system for this test set up.
